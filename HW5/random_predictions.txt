Answer: population_1 ( m0 )
answer ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) )
answer ( lowest ( intersection ( location , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( next_to_2 ( m0 ) )
answer ( intersection ( city , intersection ( major_city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer(largest_one(state_count_1, river))
I'm sorry, but there is no "m0 river." Can you please clarify your question?
answer ( intersection ( state , intersects_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( count ( next_to_1 ( river ) , state ) )
answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( smallest_one ( area_1 , state ) )
answer ( state_1 ( highest ( peak_1 ( country ) ) ) )
answer ( count_1 ( intersection ( state , has_city_1 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( largest ( intersection ( state , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( largest_one ( population_1 , intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer (shortest (intersection (river, loc_2 (m0))))
As the question is currently stated, it is ambiguous what "m0" refers to. Please clarify the context of the question.
answer ( count ( intersection ( river , intersect_component ( m0 ) ) ) )
The sentence has already been parsed and the answer is: answer ( largest ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ). The answer is the same as the previous question about the largest city in M0.
Sorry, I cannot answer this question as it is too broad and requires more specific information. Can you please provide me with more context or details so I can better understand and provide a proper response?
answer ( state_1 ( capital_1 ( m0 ) ) )
I already answered this question before. The answer is: answer ( intersection ( capital , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( smallest_one ( elevation_1 , state ) )
clarification needed - do you mean the largest city that is also a capital, or the capital with the largest population?
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )
I am sorry, the sentence "what are the major cities in the smallest state in the m0" is invalid or incomplete as it is not clear what "in the m0" refers to. Please try again with a valid sentence.
answer ( longest_one ( intersection ( river , next_to_1 ( intersection ( state , next_to_1 ( largest_one ( next_to_1 ( state ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )

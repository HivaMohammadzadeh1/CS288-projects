answer ( most ( state , next_to_2 , state ) )
answer ( smallest_one ( population_1 , city ) )
answer ( intersection ( capital , loc_2 ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ) )
Answer: answer ( highest ( intersection ( place , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ). This sentence is asking for the location of the highest point in a place called "m0". The sentence is parsed using natural language processing techniques to identify the relevant keywords and their relationships with each other, resulting in the answer being a function that returns the highest point at the intersection of the place and the location "m0".
answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )
The sentence is asking for a list of all the rivers in the location "m0". The answer to this question is "answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )".
answer ( lowest ( intersection ( place , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
The sentence is asking for a list of major cities located in the place referred to as "m0". The answer consists of finding the intersection of the sets of major cities and cities located in "m0", using the loc_2 function, which is a locator function that identifies the relevant place.
answer ( most ( river , traverse_2 , state ) )
The sentence is a question asking for the length of the river referred to as "m0".
answer ( intersection ( state , traverse_1 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( count ( state , next_to_2 ( major ( river ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( smallest_one ( area_1 , state ) )
answer ( loc_2 ( state_with_peak ( highest ( intersection ( place , loc_2 ( country ) ) ) ) ) )
Sorry, I cannot parse that sentence because it is not providing sufficient information or structure to be parsed. It is a question, but it does not contain a clear inquiry or context to derive an answer.
answer ( intersection ( river , intersects ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( largest ( intersection ( state , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
The sentence is asking for the population of a place called "m0". The answer given is "answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )", which suggests that there is a function called "population_1" that can provide the population of a place, and the specific value for "m0" needs to be provided as an argument to this function.
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( largest ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
answer ( length ( shortest ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( major , intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ) 

The sentence is asking for the major cities that are located in a certain area denoted as "m0". The answer is produced by taking the intersection of the set of major cities and the set of cities that are located in m0.
answer ( count ( intersection ( river , m0 ) ) )
answer ( largest ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) )
I'm sorry, but the given sentence cannot be parsed as it mentions "the biggest city in the USA", which is not mentioned previously in the context.
answer ( intersection ( state , capital_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( intersection ( capital , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( state_with_lowest ( place ) )
I'm sorry but the question is incomplete. It requires additional information such as the name of the country or region for which the largest capital is being requested.
answer ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( m0 ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )
answer ( intersection ( city , loc_2 ( smallest ( intersection ( state , loc_2 ( m0 ) ) ) ) ) )
answer ( longest ( intersection ( river , loc_2 ( intersection ( state , next_to_2 ( state , largest ( next_to_1 ( state ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
answer ( population_1 ( m0 ) )
